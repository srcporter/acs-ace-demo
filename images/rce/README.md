# Remote Code Exploit example

## DANGEROUS!

This example provides an HTTP service that accepts command names and arguments in a GET query that it then executes using os.exec

In short, it is designed and built to be a remote execution vulnerability, for security demonstrations. Under no circumstances should you run this except in a completely controlled test environment.
